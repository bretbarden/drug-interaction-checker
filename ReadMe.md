DRUG INTERACTION CHECKER

BACKGROUND:
Drug Interaction Checker is an app that lets users check interactions of perscription drugs using multiple FDA drug inteaction databases. The app was created because this information resided in multiple locations on the FDA's website, which can be hard to navigate to identify which databse to check. The FDA site also only allowed one drug to be checked at a time. The Drug Ineteraction Checker app therefore checks each of these sources for the user, comparing the interactions of two different drugs and returning to the user all known interactions from the FDA's records.
